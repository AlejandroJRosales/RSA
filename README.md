# RSA
A RSA 1024 bit encrypt/decrypt program. The file named RSA 1024 bit encryption ecrypts a user inputed text using RSA 1024 bit encryption. At then end it tells the user whether the program encrypted the text correctly or not. That basically sums it up haha. The folder contains older versions of my RSA encryption.
